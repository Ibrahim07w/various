Prepositions Project
This project contains tools and utilities for working with English prepositions, implemented in Python. It is designed to help developers, linguists, and language learners analyze, process, and manipulate text with a focus on prepositional usage.

Features
Identify and extract prepositions from English sentences or texts
Analyze prepositional phrases and their usage
Support for integration into larger Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines
Modular and extensible Python codebase
Installation
Clone this repository and ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Ibrahim07w/various.git
cd various/preposition
No external dependencies are required for core functionality, but see individual scripts for optional package recommendations.

Usage
You can import the prepositions module in your Python code:

Python
from prepositions import PrepositionProcessor

text = "The cat is under the table."
processor = PrepositionProcessor()
prepositions = processor.extract(text)
print(prepositions)  # Example output: ['under']
Or use the included scripts directly for command-line processing (see script documentation for details).
