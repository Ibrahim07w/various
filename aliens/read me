#  Alien Invasion – Python Game

A classic arcade-style shooting game built using **Pygame**, where the player controls a spaceship to defend Earth from waves of alien invaders.

This project is based on the hands-on lessons from the book *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes (Chapters 12–14) and is a great introduction to object-oriented game development with Python.
